Some python version is usually installed by default. 

Install Python3:

    sudo apt-get install python3 ipython3

Pip
=======================================================================

Install pip:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo pip install --upgrade pip  ## to update it. Usually not the latest version on Ubuntu

Python 3

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip  ## ??? not sure about this


Notes [from here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/612709/trouble-with-pip-on-14-04)

1. `sudo apt-get install python-pip` installs pip in `/usr/bin`
2. `sudo pip install --upgrade pip`  installs pip in `/usr/local/bin`

So after ugrading the two pip programs are still installed. Sometimes you may need to refress the search path in your shell (open a new one or jusr reboot) 


Some Libraries I use
====================

    pip install pandas





Emacs
